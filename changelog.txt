  Changes:
    - Add Russian localization, thanks to Aquilo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4
Date: 2022-05-15
  Changes:
    - Rework crude oil production loop to better balance the ratio of required machines and make things more OCD-friendly. Specific changes below.
    - Blood Separation: Increase crafting time from 8s to 60s. Produces 5 Blood Tissue instead of 20.
    - Biomass from Blood Tissue: Increase crafting time from 20s to 30s. Requires 5 Wood instead of 10. Requires 50 Oxygen instead of 100. Produces 5 Biomass instead of 10.
    - Stem cells from lab-grown embryo: Increase crafting time from 8s to 30s. Now has 80% chance to return Lab-grown embryo and 20% chance to return Empty lab capsule (no more Empty lab capsule sink). Due to how the game's % result works, the recipe will sometimes return nothing or will return both embryo and empty capsule. Not ideal, but over time the 80%-20% ratio will be true.
    - Stem cells from spawner egg: Increase crafting time from 8s to 30s.
    - Lab-grown embryo: Requires 5 Biomass instead of 10. Requires 5 Stem cell flasks instead of 10.
    - Lab-grown embryo liquefaction: Reduce crafting time from 15 to 12. No longer requires 5 Biomass.
    - Spawner egg liquefaction: Reduce crafting time from 30 to 24. No longer requires 5 Biomass.

Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2022-05-09
  Changes:
    - Fix BZ mods requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2022-05-09
  Changes:
    - Fix not being able to add productivity modules to BZ ores catalytic electrolysis.

Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2022-05-05
  Changes:
    - Add Stone and Coal to Big blood crystal smelting.
    - Rebalance vanilla and BZ ores chances from blood crystals smelting.
    - Rebalance blood costs of some Catalytic electrolysis recipes.
    - Increase Dirty Water byproduct of Catalytic electrolysis recipes.
    - Blood crystal powder liquefaction now yields more blood per BZ mod installed. This is to prevent blood crystals smelting from becoming far better choice compared to blood recipes when BZ mods are installed.
    - Reduce Blood crystal powder cost in Wood recipe from 5 to 4.
    - Increase Nitrogen cost from 10 to 50 for Blood plasma barrel.
    - Fix Catalytic electrolysis for Uranium ore giving way too much ore.
