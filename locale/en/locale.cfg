# Settings
[mod-setting-name]
blood_richness_multiplier=Blood richness multiplier (Default: 1) [img=info]
modify_wood_recipes=Modify wood recipes (Default: enabled) [img=info]

[mod-setting-description]
blood_richness_multiplier=Multiplies the amount of blood crystal powder obtained from blood crystals, and the amount of resources from smelting blood crystals.
modify_wood_recipes=If enabled, wood recipes are modified to require a blood product. If not enabled, existing wood recipes are not changed and additional recipes are added instead. Consider enabling this if starting a new game, and not enabling this setting if you are adding this mod to an existing factory and do not want to rework wood production. Also disable this if you are not expecting to have biters around early on.
